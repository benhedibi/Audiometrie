# Patient2k19 


Is a database application that I have developped for a Hearing Loss Measurement Lab in North Africa. They were having some critical issues with the very aged software they were using (16 years old), a Software which was built around the old mighty Paradox Database. Some of the issues they were having are :

- Constant losses and corruptions of the database records.
- Random crashes which occur frequently while editing or adding new patient's records to the measurements database.
- The blob data storage was completely corrupted thus various functionalities were impossible to use without crashing the application.
- Sometimes whenever they add a new record : instead of getting appended, it just overwrites a random record in the database.
- Plus a lot of other weired bugs.

I was asked to build a new application from scratch in order to correct all the mentionned bugs as well as adding some useful functionalities. I was having a very tight schedule as I was immigrating to Canada with only 2 months in hands.
